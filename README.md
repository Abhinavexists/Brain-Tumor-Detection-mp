## Overview

Brain tumor detection is essential for early intervention, and deep learning offers promising results in MRI analysis. This project compares three models:
1. **Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
2. **VGG16 Transfer Learning**
3. **ResNet50 Transfer Learning**

## Models

### 1. Custom CNN with Caltech101
- **Dataset**: Caltech101, tailored for brain tumor classification
- **Architecture**: Custom CNN optimized for brain imaging
- **Training**: Uses data augmentation

### 2. VGG16 Transfer Learning
- **Architecture**: VGG16 with modified layers for binary classification
- **Pre-trained on**: Large datasets, fine-tuned for MRI
- **Advantages**: Adapted for tumor classification

### 3. ResNet50 Transfer Learning
- **Architecture**: ResNet50 with skip connections for better gradient flow
- **Training**: Fine-tuned specifically for medical imaging
- **Advantages**: Enhanced performance via skip connections

## Dataset

The models are trained and evaluated on a brain MRI dataset. Use the provided dataset or configure paths in the configuration file if using a custom dataset.

## Requirements

All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them as follows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brain-Tumor-Detection/BrainTumorDetection.git
   cd Brain-Tumor-Detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and place the dataset in the specified folder.

## Usage

1. **Run the Notebooks in Jupyter**:
   - Open each notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the models:
     - `Custom_CNN_Training.ipynb`
     - `VGG16_Transfer_Learning.ipynb`
     - `ResNet50_Transfer_Learning.ipynb`

2. **Command Line Execution**:
   - You can run the notebooks from the command line by converting them to Python scripts:
     ```bash
     jupyter nbconvert --to script Custom_CNN_Training.ipynb
     python Custom_CNN_Training.py
     ```

3. **Evaluate Model**:
   - Convert the evaluation notebook to a script or run directly in Jupyter:
     ```bash
     jupyter nbconvert --to script evaluate_model.ipynb
     python evaluate_model.py
     ```

### Configuration
Update configuration files to specify training parameters like learning rate, batch size, and data paths.
